Solutions Consultant assignment - pay and refund app for android.

Instructions from Payworks

More specifically, we’d like you to build an Android application that has the following functionality:

A Textfield to enter an amount
A Button “Pay" to make payment
A Button “Refund” to refund the last transaction

Here are the steps you should take:
1) Make yourself familiar with coding for Android, https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html
2) Download and install the Android IDE, Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
3) Start a project within Android studio and add the UI items using the Interface Builder
4) Install the Payworks SDK within the project by following the instructions
here: http://www.payworks.mpymnt.com/node/143#android
5) Use the Payworks documentation to find the code needed for the “Pay” and “Refund” buttons
6) Create a Github Account (https://github.com/) and make your project available there

Don’t forget to test your app on your phone or with the Android simulator.
At the end, it should be possible for us to clone your Github repository, run your code and test it.
Please send us an email when you are done which includes the link to Github repository with your code.
